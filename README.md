# Counting-Cards-in-Black-Jack
A model that attempts to learn and benefit from data collected on card counting. A decision tree like model is built to win more often than loose and increase the bet of the player appropriately to come out winning as much money as possible.

To run, make sure the 4 external class files are imported properly, and then execute p1_blackjack as a whole. The output should be 2 normal distributions of the two methods of play(normal, or card counter) and their winnings.
